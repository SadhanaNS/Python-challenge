3.Largest among Three Numbers: Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest among them.

4.Leap Year Checker: Write a Python program that takes a year as input and prints whether it's a leap year or not. (A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400.)

5.Vowel or Consonant: Write a Python program that takes a character (a-z or A-Z) as input and prints whether it's a vowel or a consonant.

7.Triangle Type Checker: Write a Python program that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle as input and prints out whether it's an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle.

8.Number Comparison: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints out whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

9.Positive, Negative, or Zero: Write a Python program that takes a number as input and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

10.Day of the Week: Write a Python program that takes a number representing the day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.) as input and prints out the corresponding day.
